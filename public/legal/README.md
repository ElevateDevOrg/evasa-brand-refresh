# Legal Documents

Place finalized documents here so they are served at the following URLs:

- /legal/appeals-process.pdf
- /legal/complaints-process.pdf
- /legal/impartiality-statement.pdf

File naming guidance:
- Use lower-case, hyphen-separated filenames.
- Prefer PDF for fixed-layout, printable policy documents.

Deployment notes:
- Files inside `public/` are copied to the site root by Vite at build time.
- Replacing any file here and redeploying updates the live document URLs.
